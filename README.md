# Reversible-Jump-Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo(RJMCMC) with Simulated Annealing

## Introduction

This repo is about using Reversible Jump MCMC and Simulated Annealing algorithm to train Radial Basis Function(RBF) network, so that we can obtain a model with uncertain parameter dimensions. Besides, different model choosing approaches including AIC, BIC, MDL, MAP, HQC, and their performance are compared.
